### ðŸš€ Individual Token Selling

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `TokenCard` Component
- Handles touch and mouse events for swipe gestures

- Implements smooth animations and transitions

#### `SwipePage` Component
- Main page component managing token state
- Integrates with existing hooks (`useTokenBalances`, `useBatchSelling`)
- Handles individual token selling on swipe left

### Key Features

#### Swipe Detection
```typescript
const threshold = 100;
if (dragOffset.x > threshold) {
  onSwipeRight(); // Keep token
} else if (dragOffset.x < -threshold) {
  onSwipeLeft(); // Sell token immediately via Bridge API
}
```

#### Visual Feedback
