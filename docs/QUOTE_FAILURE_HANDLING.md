# Quote Failure Handling

## Overview

The batch selling functionality has been improved to handle individual quote failures gracefully instead of failing the entire transaction. This ensures that users can still proceed with selling tokens even if some quotes fail to fetch.

## What Was Changed

### Before
- If any single quote failed to fetch, the entire batch transaction would be aborted
- Users would see a generic error message and have to retry the entire process
- No visibility into which specific tokens failed to get quotes

### After
- Individual quote failures are tracked and reported to the user
- Users can proceed with the tokens that have successful quotes
- Clear feedback about which tokens were skipped and which were included
- Detailed success messages showing exactly what was sold

## Implementation Details

### Quote Collection Process

```typescript
const quotesWithTokens: { token: ProcessedToken; quote: any }[] = [];
const failedQuotes: ProcessedToken[] = [];

// Get quotes for all tokens, tracking which ones fail
for (const token of tokensToSell) {
  const quote = await getSellQuote(token);
  
  if (!quote) {
    failedQuotes.push(token);
    toast.warning(`Could not get quote for ${token.symbol} - it will be skipped`);
  } else {
    quotesWithTokens.push({ token, quote });
  }
}
```

### User Feedback

1. **Immediate Feedback**: When a quote fails, users see a warning toast:
   ```
   "Could not get quote for TOKEN_SYMBOL - it will be skipped"
   ```

2. **Summary Before Execution**: If some quotes failed, users see an info message:
   ```
   "Proceeding with X tokens. Failed to get quotes for: TOKEN1, TOKEN2"
   ```

3. **Success Message**: After successful execution, users see detailed results:
   ```
   "Successfully initiated batch sell for 3 tokens: TOKEN1, TOKEN2, TOKEN3! ðŸŽ‰ (Skipped: TOKEN4, TOKEN5)"
   ```

### Error Handling

- **All Quotes Failed**: If no quotes succeed, the transaction is aborted with a clear error message
- **Partial Success**: Users can proceed with the tokens that have successful quotes
- **Transaction Success**: Cache is invalidated and state is reset regardless of how many tokens were sold

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users don't lose progress when some quotes fail
2. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into what succeeded and what failed
3. **Flexibility**: Users can still sell their tokens even if some are temporarily unavailable
4. **Reduced Friction**: No need to retry the entire process when only some tokens have issues

## Technical Considerations

- Failed quotes are logged for debugging purposes
- The batch transaction only includes calls for tokens with successful quotes
- Cache invalidation still occurs after successful transactions
- State management properly resets after completion

## Future Improvements

- Add retry logic for failed quotes
- Implement quote caching to reduce API calls
- Add more detailed error messages for specific failure reasons
- Consider implementing fallback quote providers
