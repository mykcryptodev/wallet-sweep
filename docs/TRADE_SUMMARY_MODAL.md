# Trade Summary Modal

## Overview

The Trade Summary Modal is a new feature that provides users with a comprehensive summary of their trading activity instead of relying on toast notifications. The modal slides up from the bottom of the screen with a smooth animation and presents detailed information about the trade.

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Bottom-up animation**: Modal slides up from the bottom with a smooth transition
- **Backdrop blur**: Semi-transparent backdrop with blur effect
- **Rounded corners**: Modern design with rounded top corners
- **Handle indicator**: Visual handle at the top for better UX

### Content Display
- **Success icon**: Green checkmark icon to indicate successful trade
- **Summary statistics**: Total value and destination token information
- **Token breakdown**: Separate sections for successfully sold tokens and failed quotes
- **Transaction link**: Direct link to view the transaction on BaseScan
- **Close button**: Easy dismissal of the modal

### Information Shown
1. **Successful tokens**: List of tokens that were successfully sold with their values
2. **Failed tokens**: List of tokens that couldn't be quoted (with reasons)
3. **Total value**: Sum of all successfully sold tokens
4. **Destination token**: What the tokens were sold for (USDC or ETH)
5. **Transaction hash**: Link to view the transaction on blockchain explorer

## Implementation

### Components
- `TradeSummaryModal.tsx`: Main modal component with animation and layout
- `useBatchSelling.ts`: Hook updated to manage modal state and trade summary data

### State Management
The modal uses local state to manage:
- `isOpen`: Controls modal visibility
- `isVisible`: Handles animation timing
- `tradeSummary`: Contains all trade data (successful/failed tokens, transaction hash)

### Animation
- Uses CSS transforms for smooth bottom-up animation
- 300ms transition duration with ease-out timing
- Backdrop click to close functionality
- Proper cleanup on unmount

## Usage

The modal is automatically triggered when a batch sell transaction completes successfully. Users can:

1. **View trade details**: See exactly what was sold and for how much
2. **Check failed tokens**: Understand which tokens couldn't be quoted
3. **Access transaction**: Click to view the transaction on BaseScan
4. **Dismiss**: Click "Done" or tap the backdrop to close

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: More detailed information than toast notifications
- **Visual appeal**: Modern design with smooth animations
- **Comprehensive data**: Shows both successful and failed trades
- **Easy access**: Direct link to transaction details
- **Mobile-friendly**: Bottom-up design works well on mobile devices
